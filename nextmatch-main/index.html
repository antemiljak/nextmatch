                Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
                 kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means
                 the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports
                commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North 
                America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football).
